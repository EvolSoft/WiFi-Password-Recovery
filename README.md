# WiFi Password Recovery

[![Download WiFi Password Recovery](https://img.shields.io/sourceforge/dt/wifi-password-recovery.svg)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wifi-password-recovery/files/latest/download)

WiFi Password Recovery is a free utility to recover the passwords of the WiFi networks saved on your computer. For example if you forgot the password of a WiFi network (which you have entered in the past), you can easily recover it thanks to this tool. WiFi Password Recovery provides a very simple user interface which shows also other informations (SSID, Interface, Security type, Encryption algorithm) for each wireless network. The program is able to recover the passwords of wireless networks which use the following security types: WEP, WPA, WPA-PSK, WPA2, WPA2-PSK.*

**Note: On Windows XP the passwords of WiFi networks using WPA security will be shown as 64 HEX digits. You can use these characters as password to connect to the wireless network anyway.**

## Requirements

- Windows XP SP3, Vista, 7, 8.x, 10
- A wireless network card of course

## Compiling source code

To compile WiFi Password Recovery source code you need:
- *MinGW-w64* compiler 
- *wxWidgets* 2.8

Before compiling source code you may need to modify the *Makefile* in order to set the right compiler and libraries paths. After doing that, run:

```
mingw32-make clean
```

and

```
mingw32-make
```

If the compilation succeeds, you will find the generated object files into *obj/* folder and the main executable into *bin/* folder.

Don't forget to add the runtime libraries inside the executable path before running it otherwise it will not work.
